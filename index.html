    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks?</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">
        <li>1. Keep software up to date: Regularly updating software (e.g., content management system, plugins, and server software) can help ensure that known security vulnerabilities are patched and fixed.</li>
        <li>2. Use strong and unique passwords: Strong passwords with a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters can help protect against brute force attacks. Additionally, using unique passwords for each account can help prevent a data breach on one site from compromising other accounts.</li>
        <li>3. Implement HTTPS: HTTPS encrypts communication between the user's browser and the web server, which helps protect against man-in-the-middle attacks and data interception.</li>
        <li>4. Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF): A WAF can help detect and block malicious traffic, such as SQL injection attacks, cross-site scripting attacks, and other common web security vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li>5. Use two-factor authentication (2FA): 2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a user to enter a code or use a biometric factor (e.g., fingerprint, face recognition) in addition to a password.</li>
        <li>6. Regularly back up website data: Regular backups can help ensure that website data can be restored in case of a data breach or other issue.</li>
        <li>7. Use security plugins or services: Many content management systems have security plugins or services available that can help protect against common web security vulnerabilities.</li>
